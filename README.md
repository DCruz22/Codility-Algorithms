# Codility Algorithms
Almost all programmers have had an algorithm solving period. This is more common when a developer is preparing for a coding interview. 
Some of the most used websites to practice algorithms are [Codility](http://codility.com/), [Leetcode](http://leetcode.com) and 
[HackerRank](http://hackerrank.com/).

These are the pages i use to practice and i have learned a lot from them. However, it always bothered my that i can't easily check my 
past solutions in Codility like i can in the other pages. So i decided to create this repo to keep track of my solutions using Java
as the programming language.
